## SOLSTICE Content Management System Front-end

### Running Locally:
To set up your project locally ensure that you have the "server" repo downloaded as well and running already (instructions on how to run provided in the README file for that project). NOTE: to get the server repo running correctly (i.e. ensure that you are connected to our solstice database), you will need to be connected to Michigan's VPN service (https://its.umich.edu/enterprise/wifi-networks/vpn/getting-started).

Once server is running, verify that you have a .env file in this project and that the environment variable REACT_APP_ENTRIES_API is defined with the port on your computer that the server is running on. For example, if my server is running on port 3001 (which is the default port defined by the project), REACT_APP_ENTRIES_API=http://localhost:3001/ should be contained in the .env file.

Now that your project is set up, use `npm start` to run the front end.

### Uploading to Openshift
Within this repo, you can find a dockerfile, which outlines how the image we will upload to Openshift is built.

After logging in to the solstice project in Openshift, use the new-app command to upload the image to that project (you will need to do the same with the back-end). 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
